DPTechnics dpt-breakout-server
==============================

Server that runs the DPT-Board and DPT-Board+ web interface. It
is continuously being expanded with more and more functionality. 

Speed is what this server is built for. Unlike others there is
no support for interpreted languages, all plain C. It can serve
static file content and server RESTful api's.

You can write modules by plugging into the api.c file. Please 
look into the folders (modules) to read how easy it is to write
modules for the breakout-server.
